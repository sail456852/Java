#Definition
Clouding computing is the processing on the Internet or a private network where the exact processor location is unknown
Use of AWS can reduce hardware, operational, and deployment costs
Cloud computing still uses servers, they are simply hidden from view
It's built on computation capability

#Benefits
Reduced: Hardware cost, Operational cost, Deployment cost
Increased: Resiliency, Performance, Capacity

#Models
Full Cloud
Hybrid Deployment
Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service): Entire infrastructure in the cloud; Platforms and software run on other's
infrastructure, you must manage it all;

PaaS (Platform as a Service): You don't manage the infrastructure; Applications are deployed on platforms;
Saas (Software as a Service): Someone else develops the software; You use it from the cloud; e.g., Email Service

#History
AWS launched in 2006 as we know it today
AWS certifications launched in 2013

#VPC
Virtual Private Cloud is something like VPN. you own remote private computing resources
An AWS instance is an instance(implementation) of an AWS machine image
The primary AWS platform includes computing, storage, database, and networking

#EC2 vs Beanstalk
EC2 you have to configure hardware parameters and dependencies for your web app
Elastic Beanstalk can automatically implement the dependencies based on your web app, e.g. your web app is .Net based

#Storages
S3: Simple Storage
EFS: Elastic FileSystem
Glacier: for archival purpose, cheapest.
Storage Gateway: local storage sync with cloud storage

#Databases
RDS: Traditional relational database
DynamoDB: NoSQL database
ElasticCache: In-Memory database, fast.

#Security
IAM & AWS Organizations

#Regions and Availability Zones
Region: Physical location or boundary with AWS data centers, one region can have many data centers
Availability Zones: 1â€“6 data centers; Redundant power and networking; Multiple availability zones are within regions
Edge Areas: nearest locations closer to customers
